## install

### You are trying to start vscode as a super user which is not recommended. If you really want to, you must specify an alternate user data directory using the --user-data-dir argument.

```
sudo code . --user-data-dir='.'
```

### libXss.so is needed

```sh
yum -y install libXScrnSaver
```
